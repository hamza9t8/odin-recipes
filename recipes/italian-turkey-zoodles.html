    <h1>Italian Turkey Zoodles</h1>
    <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F6941147.jpg&w=596&h=596&c=sc&poi=face&q=85">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ricotta cheese can be used in the place of cottage cheese, and ground beef or ground chicken can replace the ground turkey if desired. Substitute 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil for the dried if preferred. A jar of spaghetti sauce can also be used in the place of the tomatoes, tomato paste, and spices to speed things up, but I don't feel that it's quite as good.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Make zucchini noodles using a spiralizer or julienne peeler. Place noodles in a colander and cover liberally with 1 tablespoon salt. Let sit until noodles release some moisture, about 20 minutes. Rinse noodles and pat dry.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Place ground turkey, garlic salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until turkey is browned and juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Drain grease.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Push turkey to the sides of the skillet to make an empty space in the center. Add olive oil and minced garlic; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Stir diced tomatoes, tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, parsley, basil, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper into the skillet. Bring to a boil; cook until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Stir in noodles. Cover with cottage cheese. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly on top.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Turn on broiler and broil until cheese is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</p>
